                We offer free standard shipping on select orders in the contiguous United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). 
                If you would like expedited shipping, we have 2-Day and Next Day shipping options available at additional rates. Please note expedited deliveries do not deliver on weekends and holidays.
                Orders of in-stock items will be shipped within 1 business days.
                If you order on a Friday, your order will be shipped out on the following business day. This includes expedited shipping.
                Please note, it can take 1-3 days for your tracking information to become available. Our shipping carriers are experiencing unprecedented volumes and changes to procedures that are creating delays nationwide.


                We ship by FedEx, UPS, USPS, and regional freight/LTL carriers.
                Items shipped by freight MUST be shipped to a business with a dock or forklift access; otherwise, liftgate and/or residential delivery fees may apply.
                Freight shipping must go to a commercial address only; we require the name of the business, address, phone number, hours, and contact person.
                Most items ship within 24 hours of payment; items paid for on the weekend or holidays ship on the following business day.
                Any free shpping we offer is for the continental United States only. If you are from Hawaii, Alaska, or a Territory of the United States, please request a shipping total before bidding and we will do our best to keep the cost low.
                Local delivery and local pickup options are also available.
